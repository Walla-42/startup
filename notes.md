### Introduction
This document houses all of my notes taken during my participation in CS260: Web Programing and houses linkes to important documentation and resources which I used to create this project.

### Git
Instruction 1 talked about how to use Github. I already use github frequently and have no additional notes to put here for this section. I did learn that you can add a [!Note] in a markdown file, which is useful for keeping my documentation clean for the user.
