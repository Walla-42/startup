## Introduction
This document houses all of my notes taken during my participation in CS260: Web Programing and houses linkes to important documentation and resources which I used to create this project.

## Git
Instruction 1 talked about how to use Github. I already use github frequently and have no additional notes to put here for this section. I did learn that you can add a [!Note] in a markdown file, which is useful for keeping my documentation clean for the user. 

## The Internet
The internet is what connects independent networks and computing devices together. 

Every device has its own IP address which can be masked by a Domain. This domain can be used to look up the IP and vice versa using the DNS (Domain Name Server). You can view the IP address of a domain using the dig utility. 
```sh
# Example:
dig byu.edu

# Output:
byu.edu.		5755	IN	A	128.187.16.184
```

When you have a connection you can request a connection route to the device. 

To see the connection route you can use Traceroute.
```sh
âžœ  traceroute byu.edu

traceroute to byu.edu (128.187.16.184), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets

The internet is made up of many layers that all work together to process and send data to and from devices. 

### [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) layers

| Layer       | Example         | Purpose                               |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Application | HTTPS           | Functionality like web browsing       |
| Transport   | TCP             | Moving connection information packets |
| Internet    | IP              | Establishing connections              |
| Link        | Fiber, hardware | Physical connections                  |
