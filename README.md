### Elevator pitch

BioMatch is a gamified quiz platform that transforms molecular biology into a fast-paced competition. Players race against the clock to identify amino acids, nucleotides, and sequences, with scores updated to a live leaderboard. It makes learning biology competitive and fun â€” perfect for students, educators, or biology enthusiasts looking to sharpen their knowledge through real-time challenges.

### Key features

- live Game Leaderboards
- Timed minigames
- Secured Login over HTTPS
- Multiple choice and written response questions
- In-game scoring
- Game Results are persistently stored in the database for leaderboard tracking

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - To build the basic page structure. 5 total pages- Login, create account, home, game1 and game2.
- **CSS** - for application styling and design. 
- **React** - used for front end, building reusable UI components, managing user input state, managing routing between pages, and updating the page as user interact with it. 
- **Service** - backend service with endpoints for the following:
    - User registration
    - User Login
    - User Logout
    - Fetch Trivia Question
    - Fetch Molecule Picture from PubChem [PUG-REST API](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-rest)
    - Submit Game Score
    - Fetch Leaderboard 
- **DB/Login** - used to store users, and game scores in the database. Credentials are stored in the database hashed and users will be unable to participate in a game if they are not logged in. 
- **WebSocket** - When new high scores are achieved, a message is broadcast to the server. Leaderboard is updated live as scores are recieved on game end.
